Phase One

Project Review:
The most tricky one is that I want to invoke functions while I click some buttons. The only way to accomplish in PHP is using POST or GET, but I do not want to render pages again. It was not as useful as involking onclick function in JavaScript. I spent lots of time solving problems of functions. Fortunately, all of them worked well. Except for functions, I did not encounter serious issues.

Phase Two
Project phase two was much trickier than the first one. We have to carry out the search function, which took me longer than I expected. At this project, I also learned how to secure my data rather than using plain text for password and stored sensitive data in safer places like SESSION. Overall, it was a good challenge from phase one to phase two. I completely know how to build a web application using PHP. Thank you.
