Project Review:
The most tricky one is that I want to invoke functions while I click some buttons. The only way to accomplish in PHP is using POST or GET, but I do not want to render pages again. It was not as useful as involking onclick function in JavaScript. I spent lots of time solving problems of functions. Fortunately, all of them worked well. Except for functions, I did not encounter serious issues.
